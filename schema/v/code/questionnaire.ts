//A labeled layout is a tuple of 5 elements, of which the first 3 are mandatory;

//dafault alias,[], and working across databases is not common)
//
//We are considering the use of a .dts file generated from a server to support type 
//checking of the following label components: dbname, ename and cname against 
//the available databases in the server.

//Assign Peter Kamau to derive the databases from a server needed for
//describing this type so that Typescript can check the proper use of
//database, entity, column and index names. Consider a parametrized definition of 
//e.g., a dbname that is driven by a server structure similar to:-
/*
type server = {
    mutall_users:{              <----------dbname
        user:{                  <----------ename
            name:string,        <----------cname
            password:string
        }
    tracker:{intern:.....}
    rentize:{client:
}    
 
Tpyes dbname, cname and ename can be then be expressed in terms of the servers 
structure. E.g.,
type dbname = keyof server; 
type ename<dbname> = keyof server[dbname]
type cname<dbname, ename> = keyof server[dbname][ename]

The parametrized definition of a label would be:-
type label<dbname, ename, cname> = [expression, ename<dbname>, cname<bame, ename>, alias?, dbname?>]

This definition would allow teh checking of labels against the databases on the 
sever, making data loading safer.
